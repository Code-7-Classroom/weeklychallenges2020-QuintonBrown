        <p>Kevin Durant is one of four Brooklyn Nets players who have tested positive for the coronavirus. The three others weren’t named by the team. The Nets’ last game before the suspension of the NBA season was in Los Angeles when they beat the Lakers at Staples Center. Of the four players, the team said, one is exhibiting symptoms. All four were placed in isolation and under the care of team doctors.</p>

        <p>Gobert was the first NBA player to test positive for the coronavirus. His positive test is what led the NBA to suspend its season. A few days before, he had made fun of the virus, touching every microphone at a news conference. On Thursday, he issued a statement saying: “The first and most important thing is I would like to publicly apologize to the people that I may have endangered. At the time, I had no idea I was even infected. I was careless and make no excuse.”</p>

        <p>Ezequiel Garay tested positive for the coronavirus, making him the first Spanish league player to confirm he has been infected. “I have tested positive for the coronavirus,” Garay wrote on a social media account Sunday. “I feel well and now the only thing to do is to follow the instructions of health officials to remain confined.” Valencia added in a statement that a total of five members of its staff and team have the new virus, without specifying if Garay is the only player. The team said the individuals are in good health and confined to their homes.</p>
