/* VERY EASY: Create two variables and assign a number to each. Console log the difference between the numbers. 
Example output: “The difference between 6 and 2 is 4” */


var num1 = 2;
var num2 = 6;
var total = (num2-num1);

console.log(total);
console.log('The difference between ' + num2 + ' and ' + num1 + ' is ' + total);
